<ol>
<li>1)	Avoiding button mashing</li>
a.	The user should watch the boss and respond correspondingly to his actions
b.	As outlined further in later characteristics, the fight is a conversation, and you can't have a conversation by saying the same thing over and over
<li>2)	Rhythm</li>
a.	The boss (and probably the player in some sense) should follow a rhythm in his attacks
b.	This will mean that the player can see the telegraph for the start of a combo and know when all the strikes of that combo will be thrown without needing individual telegraphs for each attack.
<li>3)	A wide variety of moves</li>
a.	This would include a variety of different attacks, different defense methods, and repositioning mechanisms
b.	This will provide the player with a wide range of options, many of which won’t be viable in certain fights
c.	Repositioning is particularly important since an important aspect of dancing is changing position
<li>4)	Telegraphs</li>
a.	The boss should always signal what he is about to do in the same way that the lead member of a dance should always signal what he plans on doing
b.	The follower (the player) can then know what to expect and react accordingly
<li>5)	giving and taking</li>
a.	The opportunity to attack should switch between the boss and the player
b.	This way, both characters will be carefully focusing on the other and understand what the other is doing and is going to do
<li>6)	as an extension to 1 and 5, no overwhelming the boss</li>
a.	Trying to be in charge and attempting to force the other to submit doesn’t work in dancing and it won’t work in combat either
b.	It should be impossible for the player to repeatedly attack the boss without consequence
c.	Allowing this would cause the fight to shift from a dance to a headbutt
<li>7)	fluid movements</li>
a.	Not only should the fight feel like dancing, but it should also look like dancing
b.	The characters should move and attack smoothly and effortlessly
c.	Of course, some bosses would move more jankily, or strike less fluidly, but most should look like they were dancing
<li>8)	limited "cheesing"</li>
a.	This relates to 1, but also gives a purpose to 3
b.	The user should not only have a wide variety of moves available, but also find that they must vary their attack patterns
c.	This ties in with the boss’s choice of moves. Should they detect cheesing or too much repetition, they will respond and force the player to change tactics
