<ol>
<li>Avoiding button mashing</li>
<ul>
<li>The user should watch the boss and respond correspondingly to his actions</li>
<li>As outlined further in later characteristics, the fight is a conversation, and you can't have a conversation by saying the same thing over and over</li>
</ul>
<li>Rhythm</li>
<ul>
<li>The boss (and probably the player in some sense) should follow a rhythm in his attacks</li>
<li>This will mean that the player can see the telegraph for the start of a combo and know when all the strikes of that combo will be thrown without needing individual telegraphs for each attack.</li>
</ul>
<li>A wide variety of moves</li>
<ul>
<li>This would include a variety of different attacks, different defense methods, and repositioning mechanisms</li>
<li>This will provide the player with a wide range of options, many of which won’t be viable in certain fights</li>
<li>Repositioning is particularly important since an important aspect of dancing is changing position</li>
</ul>
<li>Telegraphs</li>
<ul>
<li>The boss should always signal what he is about to do in the same way that the lead member of a dance should always signal what he plans on doing</li>
<li>The follower (the player) can then know what to expect and react accordingly</li>
</ul>
<li>giving and taking</li>
<ul>
<li>The opportunity to attack should switch between the boss and the player</li>
<li>This way, both characters will be carefully focusing on the other and understand what the other is doing and is going to do</li>
</ul>
<li>as an extension to 1 and 5, no overwhelming the boss</li>
<ul>
<li>Trying to be in charge and attempting to force the other to submit doesn’t work in dancing and it won’t work in combat either</li>
<li>It should be impossible for the player to repeatedly attack the boss without consequence</li>
<li>Allowing this would cause the fight to shift from a dance to a headbutt</li>
</ul>
<li>fluid movements</li>
<ul>
<li>Not only should the fight feel like dancing, but it should also look like dancing</li>
<li>The characters should move and attack smoothly and effortlessly</li>
<li>Of course, some bosses would move more jankily, or strike less fluidly, but most should look like they were dancing</li>
</ul>
<li>limited "cheesing"</li>
<ul>
<li>This relates to 1, but also gives a purpose to 3</li>
<li>The user should not only have a wide variety of moves available, but also find that they must vary their attack patterns</li>
<li>This ties in with the boss’s choice of moves. Should they detect cheesing or too much repetition, they will respond and force the player to change tactics</li>
</ul>
