This is a 3D fighting game that is inspired by popular games with fighting mechanics that can feel like the player is dancing with their opponent at times. Such games include the Dark Souls series, the Witcher, Final Fantasy 15, Dragon Age: Inquisition, and Monster Hunter.

With this game, we intend to explore the relationship between the player and their opponent through fighting mechanics. This exploration will be aided by background music for each fight and an enemy that move in sync with that music.
