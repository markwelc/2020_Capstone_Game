<h1 align="center">Dance of Warriors</h1>

This is a 3D fighting game that is inspired by popular games with fighting mechanics that can feel like the player is dancing with their opponent at times. Such games include: <p><ul><li>The Dark Souls series</li><li>The Witcher</li><li>Final Fantasy 15</li><li>Dragon Age: Inquisition</li><li>Monster Hunter</li></ul>
<p>
Oftentimes in video games, a boss fight can feel like a dance: the player watches the moves that the boss makes and responds accordingly. The player can learn that the boss has a rhythm, and then they can react according to every move they encounter from the boss.
<p>
With this game, we intend to explore the relationship between the player and their opponent through fighting mechanics. This exploration will be aided by background music for each fight and an enemy that moves in sync with that music.
